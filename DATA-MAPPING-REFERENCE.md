## Database Schema Changes

### Template Realignment and Validation System Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-18

**Major Changes**:

1. **Complete Template Realignment**
   - Rebuilt junction table (`RangeToCampaign`) from CSV templates exactly
   - Processed both Derma and Nivea templates to create accurate many-to-many mappings
   - Fixed campaign placement issues (e.g., "Potinhos" moved from "Luminous 630" to "Facial")
   - 162 campaign-range relationships now match templates exactly

2. **Exception-Based Validation System**
   - Implemented shared campaign handling for 11 campaigns that appear in multiple ranges
   - Added `SHARED_CAMPAIGNS` constant for campaigns like "Search AWON" and Luminous campaigns
   - Updated validation logic to use many-to-many mappings for shared campaigns only
   - Preserved existing validation for 99% of regular campaigns

3. **Master Data API Enhancement**
   - Enhanced to load junction table data alongside direct range relationships
   - Added proper null checks and error handling for orphaned records
   - Now includes 172 many-to-many campaign relationships

4. **Safe Import Scripts**
   - Created `ValidationUtility` class for comprehensive data validation
   - Developed safe import scripts for FC05 data with pre-validation
   - Prevents import of mismatched data that would break existing mappings
   - Validates against current category, range, and campaign mappings

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `scripts/complete-template-realignment.ts` - Template realignment script
- `scripts/validation-utility.ts` - Validation utility class
- `scripts/import-fc05-sufficiency-safe.ts` - Safe sufficiency import
- `scripts/import-fc05-gameplans-safe.ts` - Safe gameplan import
- `src/lib/validation/mediaSufficiencyValidator.ts` - Exception-based validation
- `src/app/api/admin/media-sufficiency/master-data/route.ts` - Enhanced master data loading

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema:
- **Primary Tables**: business_units, categories, ranges, campaigns
- **Junction Tables**: business_unit_to_category, category_to_range, range_to_campaigns (via range_id)
- **Relationship Model**: Many-to-many between business units and categories

### API Endpoints Updated:
- `/api/admin/categories` - Uses businessUnitToCategories relationship
- `/api/admin/mapping` - Uses businessUnitToCategories relationship

### Admin Interface:
- **Categories Page**: Shows hierarchical Business Unit → Category → Range structure
- **Mapping Page**: Shows complete Business Unit → Category → Range → Campaign hierarchy
- **Both pages**: Now show consistent category counts and relationships

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Data:
1. **New Categories**: Create in categories table, then add to business_unit_to_category
2. **New Ranges**: Create in ranges table, then add to category_to_range  
3. **New Campaigns**: Create in campaigns table with correct range_id
4. **Shared Categories**: Use business_unit_to_category for multiple business unit assignments

### Data Verification:
1. **Template Compliance**: Always verify new mappings against CSV templates
2. **Relationship Integrity**: Ensure all many-to-many relationships are properly maintained
3. **Campaign Assignments**: Verify campaigns are in correct ranges per template specifications

### Backup Strategy:
- Database backups created before major restructuring operations
- Version control for all schema and API changes
- Documentation updated with each structural change
